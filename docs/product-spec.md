Overview and personas
- Graph-driven AI agent platform composing agents, tools, triggers, memory, and MCP servers into a live-updatable LangGraph runtime. The server exposes HTTP APIs and Socket.IO to manage the graph, provision nodes, execute tools, and observe runs. UI offers a builder to configure graphs and view checkpoints/status.
- Personas
  - Agent Builder (developer)
  - Platform Operator (SRE)
  - Integrator (app developer)

Architecture and components
- Runtime
  - Live graph runtime applies versioned diffs serially to a single named graph. PortsRegistry enables reversible edge updates; TemplateRegistry defines template factories, ports, capabilities, and config schemas.
  - Unknown-key handling and retries: apply strips unknown config keys on schema validation errors and retries up to 3 times.
  - Checkpointing via Postgres (default); streaming UI integration planned.
- Server
  - HTTP APIs and Socket.IO for management and status streaming.
  - Endpoints manage graph templates, graph state, node lifecycle/actions, dynamic-config schema, reminders, runs, vault proxy, and Nix proxy (when enabled).
- Persistence
  - Graph store: filesystem dataset (format: 2) with deterministic edge IDs, dataset-level file locks, and staged working-tree swaps. Each upsert builds a full graph tree in a sibling directory, fsyncs it, and atomically swaps it into place (conflict/timeout/persist error modes preserved).
  - Container registry: Postgres table of workspace lifecycle and TTL; cleanup service with backoff.
- Containers and workspace runtime
  - Workspaces via container provider; labeled hautech.ai/role=workspace and hautech.ai/thread_id; optional hautech.ai/platform for platform-aware reuse. Networking is managed by the runner. Optional DinD sidecar with DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375. Optional HTTP-only registry mirror reachable at http://registry-mirror:5000.
  - Exec behavior: wall/idle timeouts, abort/kill on timeout, demux, and ANSI stripping.
- Secrets and env overlays
  - Vault optionally resolves vault refs; Env overlays merge static and vault inputs; values never logged; per-node env overlays used for shell and MCP calls only.
- Observability
  - Run-events persistence logs model/tool executions; console/logger output surfaces server activity. Tracing SDK/server/UI stack was removed in issue #760; remaining references are historical until new observability plan lands.

Features and capabilities
- Agents: SimpleAgent graph with scheduling and buffer policies; dynamic summarization; restriction enforcement for tool-first flows.
- Tools: Shell, GitHub clone, Slack, finish, call_agent, manage, remind_me, unified memory tool.
- Triggers: Slack Socket Mode trigger, debug trigger.
- Memory: Memory node/connector or unified memory tool; supports connector placement and scopes.
- MCP: Local server inside workspace container with dynamic tool registration and re-sync; namespace-prefixed tool names; staleness timeout.

Core data model and state
- Graph
  - Nodes: typed by template; static config schema; capabilities (pausable, provisionable, static/dynamic configurable).
  - Edges: deterministic IDs; reversible by PortsRegistry knowledge.
  - Version: monotonically increasing; optimistic locking on apply; single graph “main”.
- Runtime status
  - Per-node paused flag; provision status (not_ready, provisioning, ready, deprovisioning, error); per-node dynamic-config readiness.
- Containers
  - container_id, node_id, thread_id, image, status, last_used_at, kill_after_at, termination_reason, metadata.labels, metadata.platform, metadata.ttlSeconds.
- Observability
  - Spans/traces keyed with nodeId/threadId; checkpoint stream events.

Behaviors and failure modes
- Graph apply
  - VERSION_CONFLICT (409), LOCK_TIMEOUT (409), PERSIST_FAILED (500).
  - Schema validation errors trigger key stripping and up to 3 retries.
- Container exec
  - executionTimeout and idleTimeout produce structured timeouts with captured tail output; runner terminates the exec process group (SIGTERM then SIGKILL) without stopping the container. Benign stop/remove errors swallowed (304/404/409).
- MCP
  - Tool call failures normalized with message/code/retriable; transport disconnect to be handled by restart/backoff (planned).
- Slack
  - Filters bot/subtype events; acks envelopes; robust error logging.
  - Socket Mode requires enabling Socket Mode plus message.* event subscriptions; provide tokens with prefixes `xapp-` (app) and `xoxb-` (bot) via UI or Vault refs.
- Cleanup
  - Exponential backoff on termination failures (max delay 15m).
- UI caveats
  - UI checkpoint stream support for Postgres is pending.

Security model
- Vault (optional) for secrets; vault endpoints require VAULT_ENABLED. Vault refs used in env overlays; secrets never logged.
- Workspace containers rely on runner-managed networking; registry mirror remains HTTP-only on the internal compose network.
- Env overlays explicit/per-exec; no host env inheritance beyond container defaults.
- API guard against forbidden MCP executable mutations.
- Access control is currently out of scope; assume trusted network.
- See also: docs/security/vault.md and docs/config/env-overlays.md

Performance and scale
- Runtime serializes applies; concurrent applies rejected with 409 on version mismatch.
- Container reuse via registry with TTL reduces cold starts.
- Platform-aware pulls slower on emulation.
- Observability storage relies on Postgres; add indices on spans by nodeId, traceId, timestamps.

Upgrade and migration
- Graph store now writes directly to the working tree at `GRAPH_REPO_PATH` using staged swaps; legacy git guards and migration tooling have been removed. Ensure any old `.git` directories are deleted or copied elsewhere before pointing the server at the path.
- UI dependency on change streams is retired alongside Mongo.
- MCP heartbeat/backoff planned; non-breaking once added.
- See: docs/graph/fs-store.md

  - Start deps (compose or local Postgres)
  - Server: pnpm -w -F @agyn/platform-server dev
  - UI: pnpm -w -F @agyn/platform-ui dev
  - Verify: curl http://localhost:3010/api/templates; open UI; connect socket to observe node_status when provisioning.
- Docker Compose stack
  - Services: postgres, vault (auto-init), registry-mirror.
  - Observability: Tracing services have been removed; follow upcoming observability docs for replacements.
  - Vault init: vault/auto-init.sh populates root token/unseal keys; set VAULT_ENABLED=true and VAULT_ADDR/VAULT_TOKEN.
  - Postgres checkpointer: LANGGRAPH_CHECKPOINTER defaults to postgres; configure POSTGRES_URL for the checkpointer connection.

Release qualification plan
- Pre-flight config
  - Validate required env vars; verify git repo access; if VAULT_ENABLED, verify connectivity and token.
- Functional smoke
  - /api/templates returns expected templates.
  - Create trivial graph with containerProvider + shell tool; exec simple command with execution+idle timeouts; verify timeouts.
  - Add MCP server node; list and invoke a trivial tool; verify namespacing.
  - Add Slack trigger (with Vault); send message; verify trigger delivery and agent run.
- Persistence
  - Git store: apply small diff twice (idempotent); stale baseVersion returns 409.
  - Postgres checkpointer: run agent loop; verify spans/checkpoints.
- Container lifecycle
  - Verify TTL and cleanup job removes expired containers; simulate removal error and observe backoff.
  - Verify platform-aware reuse and relabeling.
- Observability
  - Tracing UI has been removed; verify agent runs are visible via Threads and Timeline views.
